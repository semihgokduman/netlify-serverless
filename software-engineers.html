<h1>
  Software Engineers
</h1>

<h2>
  Level 1
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    “making it work”, working software == good software
  </li>
  <li>Suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members.</li>
  <li>Usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something.</li>
  <li>Don't know/care about the business side of the company and don't realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and don't realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain.</li>
  <li>Most of the time caught in the Somebody Else's Problem loop.</li>
  <li>Don't take initiatives and might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase.</li>
  <li>They don't participate in team discussions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Level 2
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They gain the knowledge but they get trapped into the next chain i.e. messing things up while trying to do them "the right way" e.g. hasty abstractions, overuse or unnecessary usage of Design Patterns -- they may be able to provide solution faster than the level 1 developers but the solution might put you into another rabbit-hole in the long run.</li>
  <li>Can easily become attached to their solution, become myopic, and be unable to take feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Level 3
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road.</li>
  <li>Don't have a "Shiny-Toy" syndrome. Pragmatic in the execution. Can make the tradeoffs when required, and know why. Know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic.</li>
  <li>Aware they're on a team.</li>
</ul>


<h2>
  Level 4
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development.</li>
  <li>They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code.</li>
</ul>
